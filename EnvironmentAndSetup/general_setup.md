- [Install ZSH with OhMyZsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
  - Replace ~/.zshrc with one saved.
- [Install Powerline10k Theme](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)
  - Be sure to install the fonts mentioned and select those fonts for your terminal.
  - For WSL I install "MesloLGS NF" and "DroidSansM Nerd Font" and set the "DroidSansM" in terminal.
  - Replace ~/.p10k.zshrc with one saved and source.
  - [Font glyphs from Nerdfont](https://www.nerdfonts.com/cheat-sheet)

# VIM
- [Install Vim-Plug plugin manager](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
- - Actually, this is more of a backup as I've added the auto-install snippet for vim-plug into the .vimrc file
- Replace ~/.vimrc with saved one (source with :so % or just close/re-open)
- If you have ~/.vimrc.plug, replace that with saved ones
- Load plugins by opening .vimrc or vimrc.plug file (whichever has plugins loadede) and running `:PlugInstall`

# Trouble Shooting (WSL)

I've been using this without issue in WSL, butin case you're having issues, it could be to do with your `DISPLAY1 environment variable.
If you still get the “cannot open display” error, set the DISPLAY variable as shown below.
```bash
echo "export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0" >> ~/.bashrc
```
Note: IP is the local workstation’s IP where you want the GUI application to be displayed.
