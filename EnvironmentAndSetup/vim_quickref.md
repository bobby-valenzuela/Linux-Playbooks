# Vim: Quick Reference
There are loads of good vim cheat sheets out there and this isn't a substitution, but rather a list of common/handy ones I've found to be efficient on my workflow.  
[Ultimate Cheat Sheet](https://catswhocode.com/vim-cheat-sheet)

### Moving
`m {a-z}`	Setting markers/waypoints as {a-z}  
`â€˜ {a-z}`	Move to marker/position {a-z}  
`''`	- Move to previous position  (thats two single quotes in succession, not a single double quote)


<br />

### Editing
`xp`    - swap two adjacent letters (move letter cursor one place to the right)  
`J`     - Merge lines: Apend line below to the end of the current line.  
`cc` - change entire line.  
`~` - Change casing of selected text/character under cursor.  
`g~w` - change case of word (until whitespace)  
`g~~` - change case of entire line

### Copy/Pasting
`reg`    - View registers  
`0p`     - Paste from 0 register   
`C-r0`  - Paste from 0 register into vim command line. (Useful for pasting into a search regex)  
`C-rw`  - Copy whatever word is under cursot and paste into vim command line. (Useful for pasting into a search regex)  
`"_dd`  - Delete line and yank to black hole register (keeps registers the same).  
`ayy` - Yank line to "a" register (overwriting register a).  
`Ayy` - Yank line to "a" register (appending to register a)  

<br />

_Note: '^J' in a register will be changed to a newline when pasting._

### RegEx && Searching
`\r`                - This represents newline
